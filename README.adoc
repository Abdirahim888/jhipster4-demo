== What is JHipster?

JHipster is one of those open-source projects you stumble upon and immediately think, "`Of course!`" It combines three very successful frameworks in web development: Bootstrap, AngularJS, and Spring Boot. Bootstrap was one of the first dominant web-component frameworks. Its largest appeal was that it only required a bit of HTML and it worked! All the efforts we made in the Java community to develop web components were shown a better path by Bootstrap. It leveled the playing field in HTML/CSS development, much like Apple's Human Interface Guidelines did for iOS apps.

JHipster was started by Julien Dubois in October 2013 (Julien's first commit was on https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/commit/c8630ab7af7b6a99db880b3b0e2403806b7d2436[October 21, 2013]). The first public release (version 0.3.1) was launched December 7, 2013. Since then, the project has had over 110 releases! It is an open-source, Apache 2.0-licensed project on GitHub. It has a core team of 16 developers and over 280 contributors. You can find its homepage at http://jhipster.github.io/[http://jhipster.github.io]. If you look at https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster[the project on GitHub], you can see it's mostly written in JavaScript (42%) and Java (27%).

At its core, JHipster is a http://yeoman.io/[Yeoman] generator. Yeoman is a code generator that you run with a `yo` command to generate complete applications or useful pieces of an application. Yeoman generators promote what the Yeoman team calls the "`Yeoman workflow`". This is an opinionated client-side stack of tools that can help developers quickly build beautiful web applications. It takes care of providing everything needed to get working without the normal pains associated with a manual setup.

JHipster 4 is the same JHipster many developers know and love, with a couple bright and shiny new features: namely Angular 2 and Bootstrap 4 support.

NOTE: When I say "AngularJS", I mean Angular 1.x. "Angular" is the forward-looking name for Angular 2 and beyond.

== Installing JHipster 4

The http://jhipster.github.io/installation/[Installing JHipster] instructions show you all the tools you'll need to use a released version of JHipster. These instructions have not been updated for JHipster 4, so here's the abbreviated version.

. Install Java 8 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[from Oracle].
. Install Git from https://git-scm.com.
. Install Node.js from http://nodejs.org. I used Node 6.9.1 to write this article.
. Install Yarn from https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install[using the Yarn installation instructions].
. Run the following command to install http://yeoman.io/[Yeoman].

[source]
----
yarn global add yo
----

Since JHipster 4 is not released yet, you'll need to clone its GitHub repository to create a project with it.

----
git clone https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster
----

After cloning it locally, you'll need to run `npm link` in the `generator-jhipster` directory so npm knows to use your local copy instead of trying to download and install it. You can also use `yarn link` if you'd prefer to use Yarn over npm.

== Create a Project

To create a project, open a terminal window and create a directory. For example, `mdkdir blog`. Navigate into the directory and run `yo jhipster`. You'll be asked a number of questions about the type of application you want to create and what features you'd like to include. The screenshot below shows the choices I made to create a simple blog application.

.Generating the application
image::static/generating-blog.png[Generating the application, 1082, scaledwidth=100%]

If you'd like to create a the same application I did, you can place the following `.yo-rc.json` file in an empty directory and run `yo jhipster` in it. You won't be prompted to answer any questions because the answers are already in `.yo-rc.json`.

[source,json]
----
{
  "generator-jhipster": {
    "jhipsterVersion": "3.12.2",
    "baseName": "blog",
    "packageName": "org.jhipster",
    "packageFolder": "org/jhipster",
    "serverPort": "8080",
    "authenticationType": "jwt",
    "hibernateCache": "ehcache",
    "clusteredHttpSession": false,
    "websocket": false,
    "databaseType": "sql",
    "devDatabaseType": "h2Disk",
    "prodDatabaseType": "postgresql",
    "searchEngine": false,
    "messageBroker": false,
    "buildTool": "maven",
    "enableSocialSignIn": false,
    "jwtSecretKey": "fac063fc9ee4dade2472173f04f4d19c4c434aba",
    "useSass": true,
    "clientPackageManager": "yarn",
    "applicationType": "monolith",
    "clientFramework": "angular2",

    "languages": [
      "en",

    ]
  }
}

The project creation process will take a couple minutes to run, depending on your internet connection speed. When it's finished, you should see output like the following.

.Generation success
image::static/generation-success.png[Generation success, 1082, scaledwidth=100%]

Run `/.mvnw` to start the application and navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your favorite browser. The first thing you'll notice is a hip-looking guy explaining how you can sign in or register.

.Default homepage
image::static/default-homepage.png[Default homepage, 1437, scaledwidth=100%]

Sign in with username **admin** and password **admin**, you can browser around through the Administration section. This section offers nice looking UIs on top of some Spring Boot's many monitoring and configuration features. It also allows you to administer users:

.User management
image::static/user-management.png[User management, 1437, scaledwidth=100%]

It gives you insights into Application and JVM metrics:

.Application metrics
image::static/app-metrics.png[Application and JVM Metrics, 1437, scaledwidth=100%]

And it allows you to see the Swagger docs associated with its API.

.Swagger docs
image::static/swagger-docs.png[Swagger docs, 1437, scaledwidth=100%]

You can run the following command (in a separate terminal window) to run the Protractor tests and confirm everything is working properly.

----
yarn run e2e
----

At this point, it's a good idea to check your project into Git so you can easily see what changes are made going forward.

----
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Project created"
----

== Generate Entities

For each entity you want to create, you will need:

* a database table;
* a Liquibase change set;
* a JPA entity class;
* a Spring Data `JpaRepository` interface;
* a Spring MVC `RestController` class;
* an Angular router, controller and service; and
* a HTML page.

In addition, you should have integration tests to verify that everything works and performance tests to verify that it runs fast. In an ideal world, you'd also have unit tests and integration tests for your Angular code.

The good news is JHipster can generate all of this code for you, including integration tests and performance tests. In addition, if you have entities with relationships, it will generate the necessary schema to support them (with foreign keys), and the JavaScript and HTML code to manage them. You can also set up validation to require certain fields as well as control their length.

JHipster supports several methods of code generation. The first uses its https://jhipster.github.io/creating-an-entity/[entity sub-generator]. The entity sub-generator is a command-line tool that prompts you with questions which you answer. https://jhipster.github.io/jdl-studio/[JDL-Studio] is a browser-based tool for defining your domain model with JHipster Domain Language (JDL). Finally, https://jhipster.github.io/jhipster-uml/[JHipster-UML] is an option for those that like UML. Supported UML editors include https://www.modeliosoft.com/[Modelio], http://www.umldesigner.org/[UML Designer], https://www.genmymodel.com/[GenMyModel] and http://www.visual-paradigm.com/[Visual Paradigm]. I like the visual nature of JDL-Studio, so I'll use it for this project.

Below is the entity diagram and JDL code needed to generate a simple blog with blogs, entries and tags.

.Blog entity diagram
image::static/jdl-studio.png[Blog entity diagram, 1283, scaledwidth=100%]

You can http://bit.ly/jhipster-blog-jdl[click on this URL], or copy/paste the contents of the file below to your hard drive if you'd like to follow along.

.jhipster-jdl.jh
----
entity Blog {
	name String required minlength(3),
	handle String required minlength(2)
}

entity Entry {
	title String required,
	content String required,
	date ZonedDateTime required
}

entity Tag {
	name String required minlength(2)
}

relationship ManyToOne {
	Blog{user(login)} to User
}

relationship ManyToOne {
	Entry{blog(name)} to Blog
}

relationship ManyToMany {
	Entry{tag(name)} to Tag{entry}
}

paginate Entry, Tag with infinite-scroll
----

In order to use the JHipster 4 entity generator, you **must run the following command** within your project. If you don't, the JHipster 3.x entity generator will be used and you'll end up with a bunch of AngularJS code in your project.

----
npm link generator-jhipster
----

Run the following command (in the `blog` directory) to import this file and generate entities, tests and a UI.

----
yo jhipster:import-jdl ~/Downloads/jhipster-jdl.jh
----

You'll be prompted to overwrite `src/main/resources/config/liquibase/master.xml`. Choose `a` to overwrite this file, as well as others. At the end, you might see the following output, which you can ignore. The entity sub-generator for JHipster 4 is still a work-in-progress.

----
[10:26:44] Local gulp not found in ~/dev/blog
[10:26:44] Try running: npm install gulp
----

Start the application with `/.mvnw` and you should be able to view the UI for the generated entities. Create a couple blogs for the existing `admin` and `user` users, as well as a few blog entries.

.Blogs
image::static/blogs.png[Blogs, 1157, scaledwidth=100%]

.Entries
image::static/entries.png[Entries, 1157, scaledwidth=100%]

From these screenshots, you can see that users can see each other's data, and modify it.

== Add Business Logic

To add more security around blogs and entries, open `BlogResource.java` and find the `getAllBlogs()` method. Change the following line:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/web/rest/BlogResource.java
----
List<Blog> blogs = blogRepository.findAll();
----

To:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/web/rest/BlogResource.java
----
List<Blog> blogs = blogRepository.findByUserIsCurrentUser();
----

The `findByUserIsCurrentUser()` method is generated by JHipster in the `BlogRespository` class and allows limiting results by the current user.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/repository/BlogRepository.java
----
public interface BlogRepository extends JpaRepository<Blog,Long> {

    @Query("select blog from Blog blog where blog.user.login = ?#{principal.username}")
    List<Blog> findByUserIsCurrentUser();

}
----

After making this change, re-compiling `BlogResource` should trigger a restart of the application thanks to http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html[Spring Boot's Developer tools]. If you navigate to http://localhost:8080/blogs, you should only see the blog for the current user.

.Admin's blog
image::static/blogs-admin.png[Admin's blog, 1157, scaledwidth=100%]

To add this same logic for entries, open `EntryResource.java` and find the `getAllEntries()` method. Change the following line:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/web/rest/EntryResource.java
----
Page<Entry> page = entryRepository.findAll(pageable);
----

To:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/web/rest/EntryResource.java
----
Page<Entry> page = entryRepository.findByBlogUserLoginOrderByDateDesc(SecurityUtils.getCurrentUserLogin(), pageable);
----

Using your IDE, create this method in the `EntryRepository` class. It should look as follows:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/repository/EntryRepository.java
----
Page<Entry> findByBlogUserLoginOrderByDateDesc(String currentUserLogin, Pageable pageable);
----

Recompile both changed classes and verify that the `user` user only sees the entries you created for them.

.User's entries
image::static/entries-user.png[User's entries, 1157, scaledwidth=100%]

After making this changes, commit them to Git.

----
git add .
git commit -m "Add business logic"
----
